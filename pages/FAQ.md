**I don't receive a notification when someone is knocking on my door.**
First, make sure you have allowed Qube to receive notifications. To do so click on the lock icon next to the URL in your browser.
Ensure that the dropdown for Notifications says "Allow". If not, change it accordingly.

Still no luck? Use the power button in the top right toolbar to logout and then log back in.
Also, be sure to disable Focus Assist/Do Not Disturb Mode as those will block Qube notifications.

**Can I invite offline coworkers to a meeting in qube?** Of course! This is helpful for coworkers who are on the road or find themselves without Internet access. Click the call button that appears next to someone in the side panel. This will send them a slack message with options to connect from a the Zoom app or with a regular phone number.

**Can I invite a random person to a meeting in qube?** Kind of. Click on the clipboard icon attached to the join button. You should be able to send it out to anyone, and they will be able to join you in the Zoom meeting.

**Can I invite coworkers to my office without starting a Zoom meeting?** Sure! You may want to do this if you're working together in the same room or using an alternative means of communication (such as Screenhero or a phone call). This way, your co-workers will know that you're chatting with someone. Click on the 'end meeting' dropdown and click 'cancel meeting'.

**Ahh! I think I lost my last notification.** The last 10 knock/invite events are listed in your history (available under settings (the gear icon)).

**Ahh! Something has gone wrong, and I've lost my Zoom meeting.** It's okay - just sign back into qube and click 'join meeting' to rejoin.

**Can I use Qube on my phone?** No. But you can update your qube status through Slack from your phone.

**Can I login to Qube from multiple browsers/tab?** No, and I'm not even sure why you'd want to. You can't exist in multiple offices at the same time in the real world, either.
